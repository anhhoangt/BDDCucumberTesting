Project Type: API Testing Framework

Tech Stack:
- Java
- Cucumber (Behavior Driven Development framework)
- Maven (Dependency Management)
- Likely REST-assured (Based on common usage in similar projects, though not explicitly confirmed without pom.xml content)
- Log4j (Logging).........

Architecture:
- BDD (Behavior Driven Development)
- Layered Architecture (Features, Step Definitions, Resources, POJOs)

Key Features:
- API Test Automation
- Feature File Driven Test Execution
- Reporting and Logging
- Data Parameterization

Objective: Create a simplified API testing framework capable of executing basic GET requests and validating responses against a predefined schema.
- Generate code snippets in Java.
- Use REST-assured for API calls if available, otherwise use HttpURLConnection.
- Use JUnit for assertions.
- Implement basic logging using Log4j.
- Ensure the generated code is well-formatted and easy to understand.
- Prioritize functionality over advanced features for the MVP.
- Focus on creating a working API testing framework that can execute basic GET requests and validate responses.

Implementation Steps:

1. Project Setup:
   - Create a new Maven project.
   - Add Cucumber-java, JUnit, and REST-assured (if available) dependencies to the pom.xml. If REST-assured is not available, use HttpURLConnection for basic GET requests.
   - Create a `log4j.properties` file for basic logging.

2. Feature File:
   - Create a `get_user.feature` file in the `src/test/resources/feature` directory.
   - Define a simple scenario to fetch user data from a public API (e.g., https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users/1).
   - AI Coding Assistant: Generate a `get_user.feature` file with the above scenario.

3. Step Definitions:
   - Create a `GetUserSteps.java` file in the `src/test/java/stepDefinitions` directory.
   - Implement the step definitions for the scenario defined in the feature file.
   - Use REST-assured (or HttpURLConnection) to make the API call.
   - Use JUnit assertions to validate the response status code and body content.
   - AI Coding Assistant: Generate `GetUserSteps.java` file with the above step definitions.

4. Test Runner:
   - Create a `TestRunner.java` file in the `src/test/java/cucumber/Options` directory.
   - Configure the test runner to execute the feature files.
   - AI Coding Assistant: Generate `TestRunner.java` file with the above configuration...

5. Execution:
   - Run the `TestRunner.java` file to execute the tests.
   - Verify that the test passes and the API call is successful.

6. Enhancements (Optional):
   - Implement data parameterization using Cucumber's Scenario Outline.
   - Add more assertions to validate the response body against a predefined schema (using JSON Schema Validation).
   - Implement logging using Log4j.
